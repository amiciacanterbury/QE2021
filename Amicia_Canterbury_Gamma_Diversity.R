# Gamma-diversity questions

# I did the gamma-diversity code with my Day 1: Measures of biodiversity.
# I pushed it on Tuesday 29 June already. I am just adding it below with 
# the questions I missed. 

#-----------------------------Gamma diversity-----------------------------------

# 1.ncol() counts the total number of columns. pooled() calculates the sp. richness
# across all the columns. It is different because there is a species that does 
# not occur at any of the sites. 
# Species richness counts the number of total species found in the sites being
# looked at. In gamma-diversity, when the data is pooled(), the pooled() takes out
# rare species that may cause "noise". 

# 2. pooled() data is right due to the fact that the species that does not occur
# within any of the sites, causing extra noise. Excluding it would calculate the
# actual gamma diversity of the area being looked at.
